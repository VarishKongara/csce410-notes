System Call
System call is a mechanism that allows user space programs to request services from the kernel space.
The set of system calls are APIs for the Linux kernel that provide a interface for processes to access resources and hardware withotu knowing low-level details

Application -> Library function -> Kernel -> System Call

RISC-V Assembly
Stack Pointer: sp
Frame Pointer (Functions): fp
Registers:
- a0 - a6 used to hold function arguments
- a7 is the system call number register (ID)
- a0 holds the return value
- zero holds the value zero

System Call (Trap into the kernel): 
ecall - looks at t0 or a7 depending on abi for system call number
Bit Manipulation:
- slli - shift left

Trap into the kernel
1. System calls (planned)
2. Exception (error)
3. Interrupt (event)

Stub
Template to generate a system call

System calls execution
- syscall.c
- syscall.h
- sysproc.c
- usys.S
- user.h

To add a new Hello World Call
- In syscall.c add a new entry [SYS_hello] sys_hello,
- In syscall.c add function prototype extern int sys_hello(void)
- In syscall.h add a new entry #define SYS_hello 22,
- Implement in sysproc.c, 
uint64 sys_hello(void) {
    cprintf(“Hello world\n”);
    return 12;
}
- In usys.S, create an interface to allow user programs to call this system call
.global syshello
syshello:
    li a7, SYS_hello
    ecall
    ret
- Add a function prototype that the user program will call. int hello(void);
- In usys.pl, and entry("sys_hello")
- In user.h, int sys_hello(int arg1);
